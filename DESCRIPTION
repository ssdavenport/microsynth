Title: Synthetic Control Methods with Micro- And Meso-Level Data
Version: 1.0.8
Description: A generalization of the 'Synth' package that is designed
 for data at a more granular level (e.g., micro-level). Provides
 functions to construct weights (including propensity score-type
 weights) and run analyses for synthetic control methods with
 micro- and meso-level data; see Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer 
 (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1213634>.
